## Memory Card Game - Flip It!

## Project Brief

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

<ul>
  <li>Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
  <li>Rendered using a browser</li>
  <li>Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML</li>
  <li>Deployed online using GitHub Pages/Vercel</li>
  <li>Frequent commits (at least once every day)</li>
</ul>

### Timeframe and Project Development
The time given to complete this project is 1 week.<br />

I outlined the steps I took to build this project below:
1. Draw a rough sketch of the wireframe to display the flow of the game - you can view it <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/pAYLwdUUbU9GbX8jzC97Gh/Memory-Card-Game-(Project-1)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=xMCBTFMv7KVi3MKj-1">here</a>
2. Build the skeleton of the game using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
3. Integrate the game logic using JavaScript:
   - Shuffling card deck
   - Append and render images upon clicking each card
   - Comparing two cards and invoke an action (flip it back if not identical, remain open AND disable clicks if identical)
   - Timer countdown and invoke an action (game over page if lose, next level page/game complete page if win)

## Description

Concentration or memory games are well-known among many, even for beginners who are new to gaming. I decided to build a memory card game as a way to reminisce about my childhood days - this is one of the games that introduced me to the world of gaming.

The game's objective is to click and match two identical cards until all cards are faced up within a time limit. There will be two modes - normal with a 4 x 4 grid and hard with 5 x 6.
